###This repository contains the freeMarker assignments.


#The assignments covered in this repo are:
* FreeMarkerHelloo: It contains the basic freeMarker tags. It contains configuring the freeMarker engine, calling java method from freeMarker template, using custom directives, macros, also iterating over a list and hash variable access.
* FreeMarkerServlet: In this freeMarker is integrated with the java servlets. web.xml is where configurations are done. Here I also added including the other template file in current template.
* FreemarkerSpring: Integration of freeMarker with spring is done. The *.jsp pages in normal web applications are replaced with the *.ftl(freeMarker Templates).
